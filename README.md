# JSON-tools
An app for developers who need to reformat or filter data structures saved in JSON format and compare structures with each other. JSON-tools allows you to minify an unminified JSON representation as well as the reverse operation (adding any spaces and newlines). The application will be available through a GUI as well as a remote API.
